> **Note:** In source code, the project called ``PrototipoFrontend`` was made in an ``ASP.NET 5`` project using ``MVC 5`` just to use Razor view engine to render the Single Page Application in browsers instead an *index.html*. This project is the development environment using ``Sencha Arhitect 3.2 and ExtJS 5.1.2``.

## Backend

- [x] **ASP.NET 5** with **Web API 2**
- [x] **Memory Data Caching** instead Database just for testing purpouses

> **Note:** The project called ``PrototipoServicios`` was made in ``ASP.NET 5 with Web API 2`` to create API RestFul services that provide the CRUD operations to the Frontend using Memory Data Caching on them, the programming language that was used is ``C#``.
